                    The top 10 highest mountains in Nepal are among the top 17 highest mountains in the world. 
                    The Himalaya is the youngest and highest mountain system in the world extending 
                    2,400 kilometres. Fully a third or 800 kilometres of its central section traverses Nepal and is known as the Nepal Himalaya.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nepal, the land of Himalayas is known as a mountaineers and trekkers paradise to the world. 
                    There are more than 1310 mountains in Nepal Himalaya which are over 5500m/18,090ft to 8848m/29,028ft above sea level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All 8000m above peaks are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian continental plates with 8 of them consisting in
                     Nepal. Out of the fourteen world’s highest mountain, eight are in Nepal, five in Pakistan and one in Tibet, China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With 8 mountains higher than 8000m and hundreds 
                    of peaks higher than 6000m opened for climbing, Nepal certainly tops the list of destination for mountain lovers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nepal opened its mountains/peaks for climbing in 1949 and until June 2018, the Nepal government has opened 414 peaks for climbing which are jointly 
                    managed by the Department of Tourism and Nepal Mountaineering Association.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first expedition to set foot on an 8000m peak was achieved by Maurice Herzog 
                    and Louis Lachenal in June 3rd, 1950 on the summit of Mt. Annapurna.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three years after the first ascent of 8000m peak on Mt. Annapurna, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa on May 29,1953, 
                    stood atop the world’s highest mountain, Everest. By 1960, eighty-four expeditions, both large and small, had encountered the Nepal Himalaya. 
                    Kanchenjunga and Makalu were climbed in 1955, Lhotse and Manaslu in 1956 and Dhaulagiri in 1960.

                                The Everest region in Nepal is more than just climbing and trekking, it is a life-changing experience and some see it as a journey close to achieving Nirvana. Located in the northeastern province of Nepal, this region is in a world of its own with vast glaciers, icefalls, the highest mountains, deep valleys, precarious settlements, and hardy people challenging the harshest conditions thrown at them by nature in the thin air of high altitude.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Passing through legendary Sherpa villages, the trek is a mix of deep cultural and spiritual experiences and physical challenges that test your strength and endurance. Buddhist lamas, monks and nuns led by Rinpoches (reincarnate at mas) serve the predominantly Sherpa communities from their gompas (monasteries).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The journey to Everest or Everest Base Camp begins with a dramatic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, after which you hike up the Everest region to reach your destination in the Himalayas. However, for die-hard lovers of trekking, there is another switchback starting from Jiri through the mid-hills of Solu, an ethnically diverse section of the trek rich

                                    The Everest region has been valued as the key to the evolutionary history of the Earth and is also a habitat for some rare and endangered species like the snow leopard, red panda, Himalayan black bear, musk deer and Himalayan wolves.

                          <h3>Mt. Kanchenjunga</h3>
                          <div class="hr-line"></div>
                            <p>
                                Once upon a time, Kanchenjunga was considered the highest mountain in the world. 
                                This was before the startling discovery by chief computers (today they were replaced by machines) that Peak XV was actually 
                                higher than Kanchenjunga IX. Later it became clear that Nine Peaks was actually only the third highest peak after Everest and K2
                                 (Karakorum, Pakistan). It is located 128 kilometers east of Mount Everest. The west is located in Nepal and the other is located 
                                 in the Indian state of Sikkim. Kanchenjunga or Kangchenzonga means "The Five Treasures of the Great Snow" in Sikkim because the 
                                 mountain has five prominent peaks. They are Kanchenjunga Main (8,586m), Yalongkang (8,505m), Kanchenjunga West (8,420m) and Twin 
                                 Peaks (both 8,476m). Unlike most other Himalayan peaks, this mountain runs from north to south, where the Kanchenjunga Glacier 
                                 joins the Tamur River,
                                 a tributary of Koshi. Many people considered climbing Kanchenjunga as early as 1882, but did not attempt it until 1905.

                                Mt. Lhotse is connected to Everest via the South Col and is the fourth highest mountain in the world. 
                                The main summit is 8,516 m while Lhotse Middle (East) is 8,414 metres and Lhotse Shar is 8,383 metres. 
                                Very often, climbers making an attempt on Everest, go up the Lhotse to acclimatize. In fact, the usual 
                                route leading to Everest starts up the northwest face of Lhotse and then cuts across to the more famous 
                                mountain. An early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition. It was led 
                                by Norman Dyhrenfurth and also included two Austrians, Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn as well as two Swiss 
                                climbers, Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel. 
                                It was also the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans: Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan.

                          <h3>Mt. Makalu</h3>
                          <div class="hr-line"></div>
                            <p>
                                Mt.Makalu is 20 km east of Everest in the Khumbu region and is the fifth highest moutain in the world. 
                                The mountain lies in the Makalu Barun National Park and is known for its perfect pyramid shape with four
                                 sharp ridges. North of the mountain lies Tibet and it has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, 
                                 or Makalu II, 7,678 m lies north-northwest of the main summit. The other is Chomo Lonzo which lies just 
                                 north of the main peak. The first attempt on Makalu was made by an American team led by William Siri in
                                  the spring of 1954. They attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 m by a constant barrage of storms. 
                                In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascent of the subsidiary summit

                            <p>
                                Kangchungtse on 22nd October. They were Jean Franco, Gyaltsen Norbu and Pa Norbu. Makalu was first climbed on 
                                15th May 1955 by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy, members of a French Expedition led by Jean Franco. The very next 
                                day, Franco, G. Magnone and Gyaltsen Norbu also summitted followed by Bouvier, S. Coupe, Leroux and A. Vialatte 
                                on the 17th. The expedition climbed from the north face and northeast ridge via the saddle between Makalu and 
                                Kangchungtse which subsequently became the standard route. The first ascent of the southeast ridge was made by Y. 
                                Ozaki and A. Tanaka from a Japanese expedition on 23rd May 1970. An American team had tried before them and failed.
                                 The very technical West Pillar route was climbed in May 1971 by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur. Makalu is one 
                                 of the harder eight-thousanders and is considered one of the most difficult mountains in the world to climb. 
                                 The mountain has challenging steep pitches and knife while the final ascent of the summit pyramid involves 
                                 technical rock climbing. In 2006, a French mountaineer named Jean-Christophe Lafailee disappeared on Makalu
                                  while trying to make the first winter ascent. This mountain is the only Nepalese 8,000 m peak which has yet 
                                  to be climbed in true winter conditions. The first Nepali to climb Makalu was Ang Chepal Sherpa on 1st May 1978. Note: Most of the sherpas 
                                who climbed with the expeditions in the 1950s were considered Indian nationals as they had been living in India.

                          <h3>Mt. Cho Oyu</h3>
                          <div class="hr-line"></div>
                            <p>
                                Unlike other attempts, the successful expedition to Cho Oyu had its origins in very simple circumstances. 
                                Austrian climber, Herbert Tichy along with sherpas Adjiba and Pasang were gathered around a campfire on a
                                 mountain and enjoying fried liver, when Pasang suddenly asked, “Next year, Cho Oyu?” Tichy could only 
                                 nod and repeat, “Cho Oyu”. Thus it was decided that the mountain would be attempted in 1954. In the previous 
                                 years, Everest, Nanga Parbat and Annapurna among the other eight-thousanders. had been climbed. Cho Oyu lies 
                                 20 km west of Everest, at the border between China and Nepal. In Tibetan, Cho Oyu means 
                                “Turquoise Goddess”. The first attempt on this mountain was made by an expedition supported by the Joint Himalayan Committee of Great Britain.    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As preparation for an attempt on Mount Everest the following year. With Eric Shipton as team leader, 
                                the expediton also included Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans and Tom Bourdilon, but technical 
                                difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb. It was estimated that it would 
                                take two weeks to get everyone across and it would also mean entering Tibetan territory which it is believed 
                                Shipton was unwilling to do. It was Dyhrenfurth and Shipton who first came up with measurements that put Cho
                                 Oyu sixth on the list of the highest mountains in the world. The Austrian expedition led by Herbert Tichy 
                                 arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu by means of an Indian airliner of the time.
                                  Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur from where the long trek to the mountain would
                                   begin. Tenzing and Hillary had also begun their trek to Everest from this old city. As every expedition
                                    has its peculiarities, this one was no exception. There were only three foreign climbers and eleven 
                                    sherpas on the team. Cho Oyu was finally climbed on 19th October 1954 via the northwest ridge by Tichy,
                                     Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama. Where as Shipton and team had been stopped by an ice cliff high on 
                                     the mountain, the Austrians were able to tackle the problem in an hour and head up towards the summit. 
                                     Pasang’s casual remark had led to a successful expedition. This was the fifth eight-thousander to have
                                      been climbed. Cho Oyu is considered the easiest to climb among the eight-thousanders
                                 and is also one of the most popular. The first Nepali national to climb the peak was Ang Phuri Sherpa on 29th April 1987.

                          <h3>Mt. Dhaulagiri</h3>
                          <div class="hr-line"></div>

                                The Dhaulagiri massif lies northwest of Pokhara and climbing this mountain
                                 was at first considered impossible. It looked formidable and the French 
                                 expedition that came to Nepal in 1950 and successfully climbed Annapurna
                                  I, didn’t even give this peak a second thought. Captain William Webb who 
                                  came in 1809 was the first European to set eyes on Mt. Dhaulagiri. When 
                                  he calibrated the height of the mountain, he was amazed. Up until then, 
                                  the Andes in South America were considered the highest chain of mountains
                                   in the world. The news of this new discovery left the rest of 
                                the world incredulous. For many years since the revelation, Dhaulagiri was thought to be the highest mountain in the world.

                                “The White Mountain” as it was known to foreigners, was one of the peaks that could not be 
                                conquered during the Golden Decade. Although numerous attempts were made throughout the 1950s,
                                 none were successful. A string of expeditions arrived in Nepal: the Argentineans tried their luck 
                                 in 1954. A Swiss-German team gave it a shot in 1955, and were followed by the Argentineans making a 
                                 bid in 1956 once again, but with no better luck. In 1958, the Swiss were back and returned yet again 
                                 without reaching the summit. Then it was the turn of the Austrians who could go no further than 7,802m. 
                                 In 1960, another Swiss expedition arrived in Nepal led by Max Eiselin and the team included Kurt Diemberger 
                                 and Norman Dyhrenfurth who went on to earn a name for themselves. They brought along a Pilatus Porter named ‘Yeti’ 
                                 which was piloted by Ernst Saxer for making drops on the French Pass up in the mountain. The expedition met with countless
                                  problems and was compounded by the crash of the Yeti. The pilot and repairman luckily escaped unhurt and walked all the way 
                                  back to Pokhara from the mountain. But the expedition persevered and 13th May 1960 proved to be a lucky day for the mountaineers 
                                  as it was a bright sunny day with practically no wind blowing. Six members of the expedition reached the summit to become the first 
                                  to climb Dhaulagiri. They were Kurt Diemberger, Nawang Dorjee Sherpa, Ernst Forrer, Albin Schelbert, Peter Diener and Nima Dorjee Sherpa.
                                   Ten days later, Jugo Weber and Michel Vaucher followed in their footsteps and made it to the top. Nawang Dorjee became the first Nepali 
                                   to climb the peak. The numbers were amazing on this climb, 13 members set off to climb the mountain,
                                 summitted on the 13th and it happened to be the 13 eight-thousander to be climbed. No bad luck there.

                                     Himalaya to the arid Trans-Himalayan high pastures bordering Tibet. Manaslu is derived from 
                                     the Sanskrit word Manasa and translates as “Mountain of the Spirit”. Out of the fourteen
                                      eight-thousanders, twelve were conquered by expeditions from the west while only two were
                                       accounted for by Asians. Shisha Pangma (eight-thousander)
                                     which lies in China was first climbed by the Chinese while Manaslu was first summitted by a Japanese expedition.

                                    The famous Manaslu trekking route goes around the Manaslu massif over the pass down to Annapurna. 
                                    The trekking trail follows the classic salt-trade route along the Budhi Gandaki river. The first 
                                    Japanese Manaslu Reconnaissance Expedition ventured up the mountain in 1952 when the mountain was
                                     still a virgin peak. Following this, the first climbing expedition in 1953, went up the river 
                                     Budi Gandaki’s course to reach the mountain. They were able to climb up to 7,750 m before turning back. 
                                     The expedition that came after them in 1954 was not so fortunate. Inhabitants of Samu village which lay 
                                     on their route denied them access to the mountain believing they would bring them misfortune. The mountain 
                                     they said was sacred to them. As a result, the climbers were forced to turn to Ganesh Himal instead. After 
                                     the Nepalese Government managed to pacify the villagers of Samu village, an advance party for the next expedition 
                                     was able to make their way up towards the mountain. The third Japanese Manaslu Expedition led by veteran climber, 
                                     sixty-two year old Yuko Maki arrived in Kathmandu in 1956. The team comprised Katsuro Ohara, Toshio Imanishi,
                                      Dr. Hirokichi Tatsunama, Sonosuke Chitani, Kichiro Kato, Junijiro Muraki, Kiroyoshi Otsuka, Dr. Atsushi Tokunaga,
                                       Yuichi Matsuda, Minoru Higeta and Takayoshi Yoda accompanied by Gyasten Norbu as sherpa sardar. This expedition
                                        had unique equipments, one of which was an oxygen generator which was set up in a separate tent from the climbers. 
                                        From there oxygen was pumped to all the other climbers in their respective tents. But this required the dedication 
                                        of the expedition doctor, who had to remain awake all night changing oxygen candles every one and a half hours. On
                                         9th May 1956, Imanishi and Gyaltsen reached the summit of Manaslu becoming the first to do so. They could see 
                                         Ganesh Himal, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and Machhapuchhare poking through the clouds. Following them, Kato and 
                                         Higeta also climbed to the top two days later. The Japanese team was the first Asian expedition to make a
                                          first ascent of an eight-thousander. 
                                    The first Nepali national to climb the peak was Urkien Tshering Sherpa on 22nd April 1973. Tyangboche monastery.

                                  <h3>Mt. Annapurna</h3>

                                        The Annapurna range is a series of peaks stretching 55 km with the highest point,
                                         Mt. Annapurna I, being the tenth highest summit in the world. It lies east of a 
                                         great gorge cut through the Himalaya by the Kali Gandaki River, which separates it 
                                         from the other large massif, the Dhaulagiri. Dhaulagiri I is 34 km west of Annapurna I. 
                                         In Sanskrit Annapurna literally means “full of grains” but is normally taken to mean “Goddess of Harvests”. 
                                         The Hindu Goddess of fertility is also known as Annapurna. The entire massif lies within the Annapurna Conservation
                                          Area Project (ACAP).Mt Annapurna I is the main peak of this chain of mountains which includes three other peaks 
                                          that share its name. They are Annapurna II (7.937m), Annapurna III (7,555m) and Annapurna South (7,219m). Unlike other giants,
                                         the Annapurna I barely stands out, most of it hidden by other peaks in front of it.

                                     <p>
                                        The conquest of Annapurna I was remarkable in many ways. For a start, the French climbers spent weeks just trying to 
                                        locate the mountain as it was still unexplored. It was the first eight-thousander to be climbed and even more remarkable
                                         was the fact that they did it on their first attempt. This was highly unusual as on most mountains of this size, many
                                          exploratory teams went up to study the possible routes up to the summit. Only after several expeditions had tried and 
                                          failed would one eventually succeed. When Annapurna I was climbed, Nepal was still under Rana rule and the country was
                                           strictly closed to outsiders. The climb made Maurice Herzog, the expedition leader very famous, this being the first
                                            eight-thousander to be climbed. No expeditions had taken to the mountains from Nepal before this team and so sherpas 
                                            had to be hired from Darjeeling from where many expeditions were launched via Tibet. Even before the team arrived in 
                                            Nepal, they had given themselves two options: Climb Dhaulagiri or Annapurna. Finding the former too difficult to climb,
                                             they turned their attention to the latter. As we have seen over the years of climbing history, the best time to climb 
                                             in the Himalaya is May. However, by the time Herzog and his team were heading up to the summit it was the beginning of 
                                             June. Having received news that the monsoon was to begin from 5th June, they were racing against time and made the summit 
                                             just two days before the weather changed for the worse. Herzog and Louis Lachenal reached the top on 3rd June via the north 
                                             face. The two summiteers paid a heavy price for the climb, losing their toes and some fingers to frostbite. Herzog would not climb any 
                                        major peak following this historic climb. The first Nepali climber to summit this peak was Sonam Wolang Sherpa on 13th October 1977.

                                            Gyachung Kang is a high mountain in the Khumbu region. It is the highest peak between Mount Everest and Cho Oyu. Its twin snow and rock peaks tower above the immediate surroundings, separated by a narrow saddle.

                                            The approach is easy by Gokyo Lake, then by crossing from the Ngozumpa glacier. This peak was first climbed by Y. Kato and Pasang Phutar on a Japanese expedition in 1964. The route presents some small technical difficulties and care should be taken for possible avalanches.
