                <p>
                    The small mountain kingdom of Nepal is blessed with such astonishing and unique sites that within the area of 140,800 
                    sq km Nepal holds a considerably high number of places recognised by UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific 
                    Cultural Organisation) as 'World Heritage Sites'. There are altogether ten World Heritage Sites in Nepal, seven of 
                    which are in Kathmandu itself. The list includes both natural as well as cultural sites.
                </p>
                <h3>Cultural Sites: </h3>
                <p>
                    The cultural heritage of the Kathmandu Valley is illustrated by seven groups of monuments and buildings which display 
                    the full range of historic and artistic achievements for which the Kathmandu Valley is world famous. The seven sites 
                    include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur, the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and 
                    Bauddhanath, and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan.

                <p>
                    Nepal's national parks included in the World Heritage Sites List are exceptional areas with dramatic mountains, 
                    glaciers, deep valleys and undisturbed vestiges of the 'Terai' region. Several rare species, such as the snow 
                    leopard, lesser panda, single-horned Asiatic rhinoceros and the Bengal tiger are found in these park.

                                    Manakamana means “having one’s wishes fulfilled”. Hence, Manakamana in Gorkha is one of the most visited temples in Nepal where devotees from all over Nepal and abroad throng the temple daily to offer prayers to the goddess in the belief that this will fulfill their wishes. Accessibility to this temple, which is perched on the top of a steep hill, has been enhanced by the addition of a modern cable car system which ferries the traveler from the base station on the major highway to the temple premises in just over 10 minutes. The temple is a two-tiered pagoda built in a large courtyard. Goddess Manakamana is enshrined in the form of a shila, or a large boulder, inside the temple. There are four other boulders adjacent to it representing the deities Bhairab, Ganesh, Kumari and Betaal.  
                                    </p>

                                    The temple lies in Gorkha from where the unification of Nepal started under King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Especially Saturdays and Tuesdays see maximum rush when it takes hours just to get a glimpse of the goddess in the temple. One can have panoramic views of the Manaslu and Annapurna peaks from the temple complex.

                                    There is the Bakreshwar Shiva Temple and Siddha Gufa (cave) at about an hour’s walk from the temple.

                                     There is also a Tibetan Buddhist monastery nearby. It is believed that Saint Padmasambhava meditated 
                                     in the cave known as Maratika near Halesi, which explains the large number of Buddhist pilgrims visiting 
                                     the site. Many pilgrims visit the temple during Shivaratri and Balachaturdashi festivals.

                                <p>
                                    Situated at the south end corner of the Kathmandu Valley, Dakshinkali is one of the most 
                                    famous Shakti Peeths in Kathmandu dedicated to Goddess Kali; hence the namesake which means
                                     “Kali of the south”. The temple precinct overflows with crowds of zealous devotees especially
                                      on Tuesdays and Saturdays when ritual animal sacrifices are performed. It is to be noted that
                                       Nepal’s Shakti Peeths never accept female animals for sacrifice. 
                                    Tucked in a scenic sylvan setting, the place has become a favorite haunt for picnickers.

                                    This site, situated at the foot of the Shivpuri hills in the northern-most part of the Kathmandu Valley, 
                                    has probably the largest stone statue of Lord Vishnu in Nepal reclining on a bed of snakes in the middle
                                     of a pond. The five-meter-long granite image carved out of a single rock dates back to the Lichchhavi 
                                     period. According to folklore, a farmer was ploughing his field one day when his plough struck a boulder,
                                      and to his surprise and alarm, blood started oozing out of the cut in the stone. Upon digging around the
                                       huge boulder, he unearthed the magnificent image of the reclining Vishnu that had remained buried in the
                                        ground. A big mela (fair) is held at Budhanilkantha on the auspicious 
                                    two main Ekadashis, Harishayani and Haribodhini, marking the four-month period when the Lord retires to sleep.

                                    The temple of Muktinath is in the trans-Himalayan locale of Nepal at the foot of the 
                                    snow-covered ranges at an altitude of 3,800 m. The site is sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Mukti Kshetra, or where the temple of Muktinath is situated, is mentioned in the Hindu 
                                    Scriptures such as the Ramayana, Barah Purana and Skanda Purana. The place partly owes 
                                    its fame to the fossil stones, called shaligram - considered holy by Hindus - found along
                                     the Kali Gandaki River. The fossil stones are said to represent Lord Vishnu in stone form.
                                      There is a black shaligram in the temple. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu is simple in architecture and built-in pagoda style. It is believed to have been constructed at the beginning of the 19th century. As the idol of Vishnu is considered to date from the 16th century, it is presumed that another temple stood there at the site before the current pagoda structure. Many Hindu pilgrims from Nepal and India visit the site to worship Lord Vishnu. Buddhists worship him as Avalokiteshwar. Buddhist nuns and Brahmin priests’ worship at the temple. Nearby is a temple called Jwala Mai considered sacred and worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists. An eternal blue flame keeps burning in the temple. Nearby, there are 108 sacred waterspouts (springs) where pilgrims take a ritual bath. Muktinath lies on the famous Annapurna Circuit trek visited by thousands of foreign trekkers every year. The trek starts from 
                                    Besi Sahar and passes through Manang and Thorung La Pass (5,380 m) via Muktinath to Jomsom.

                              <h3>Annapurna Region</h3>

                                <p>
                                    The legendary Annapurna region is the most diverse and popular trekking area in Nepal. From the full 
                                    three-week Annapurna Circuit, 
                                    which stretches into the historic Mustang region to short three-day treks, there's a trek suitable for everyone here. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As the name suggests, the centre piece of this part of Nepal is the range of mountains that includes Annapurna I, 
                                    the first of the 8,000 m peaks to be climbed. 
                                    Also included in this region is yet another 8,000 m giant, Dhaulagiri, which is located west of Annapurna I.
                                </p>
                                <img style="margin: auto ; margin-top: 20px; width: 91%; border-radius: 5px;" src="https://admin.ntb.gov.np/image-cache/annapurna_tk-1624452942.jpg?p=1024&s=82d7dc2b3718ca994b73209c632b4a52" alt="" />
                                <p>
                                    Between these two mountains lies the valley of the Kali-Gandaki River, the deepest gorge in the world.
                                     Trekkers encounter the interesting Thakali people in this region.
                                     They are known for being good in business ventures and their home cooking is relished by both tourists and 
                                     the Nepali people in general.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Views of lush, fertile farmland and undisturbed natural forests, snow-capped mountains, 
                                    and encounters with a mixture of many ethnic communities, all add up to a diverse range 
                                    of experiences that make the Annapurna trek one of the most satisfying treks among all
                                     destinations in Nepal.
                                </p>
                                <img style="margin: auto ; margin-top: 20px; width: 91%; border-radius: 5px;" src="https://admin.ntb.gov.np/image-cache/Annapurna4-1624452947.jpg?p=1024&s=04172469b07ab506454ad3cb874fc539" alt="" />
    
                                <p>
                                    The Annapurna chain of mountains lies inland, causing a large area including Manang and Mustang to fall in the rain shadow,
                                     where the ideal time for trekking is during the monsoon as there is no rainfall and temperatures are
                                      moderate in these areas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These parts are considerably drier than the southern slopes of the mountains. 
                                    This leads to an arid landscape that is desert-like and very different from
                                     regions lower down where there are green pastures and fertile farmland.

                                    Rara in the far north western part of Nepal is the smallest national park in the country, 
                                    while the Rara Lake is Nepal's biggest lake. The lake is 167m deep at some places, and drains 
                                    into the rivers Mugu Karnali via Nijar Khola. Chuchemara Hill at 4,087m is the best vantage point to enjoy 
                                    magnificent views of the deep blue lake, the forested hillsides and the snow capped peaks.

                                    The journey begins with a flight from Nepalgunj to Jumla, from where it is a 2-3 days hike to reach Rara Lake. 
                                    Jumla is known for its fine apples and walking through these orchards can be an interesting experience.

                                <p>
                                    The trek leads through remote countryside toward the Tibetan border.  
                                    A journey into the Jumla region and the beautiful Rara Lake is probably one of 
                                    the most fascinating treks in the Himalaya undisturbed by hordes of trekkers as one finds on other trek routes.

                                    The best time to visit the park is in the spring, summer and autumn.
                                     As more people are now visiting the park, tourist services and
                                      infrastructure have developed over the years. However, for a 
                                      great experience, it is still advisable to be self-sufficient 
                                    if you are traveling alone. Lake Rara is also a popular pilgrimage site for Nepalis.

                                    Hindu temple in Nepal. The main temple complex is open only to the Hindus; 
                                    non-Hindus must satisfy themselves by observing from the terraces just across 
                                    the Bagmati River to the east. As a mark of reverence and tradition, leather 
                                    items that include shoes, belts and cameras are 
                                    forbidden within the temple complex and must be left outside. Photography is strictly prohibited.     
                                </p>

                                    The most important festival observed here is Shivaratri, or ‘the Night of Lord Shiva’ - the night 
                                    Lord Shiva self-originated - when devotees and pilgrims from far and wide across Nepal and India, 
                                    including sadhus (barely attired holy men with long locks of hair and smeared in ashes) and ascetics,
                                     throng the temple to have a darshan (glimpse) of the sacred Shiva lingam. The other holy occasion 
                                     when devotees descend to the temple in large numbers is on Teej (a festival solely observed by Hindu women)
                                      in mid-September. The whole temple complex and the adjoining areas turn into a sea of red as women draped
                                       in their bridal red sarees and wearing yellow or green bead necklaces offer prayers for the well-being, 
                                       prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The temple is just as crowded with devotees every fortnight
                                        on the 11th day of the lunar month on Ekadashi. Among the Ekadashis, the most prominent and holiest two 
                                        are the Harishayani
                                     Ekadashi in Ashadh (June/July) and four months later, Haribodhini Ekadashi in Kartik (October/November).

                                        It is one of the famous Shakti Peeths in Nepal and is located on the banks of the Bagmati 
                                        River near the Pashupatinath Temple. Here too, non-Hindus are denied entry. The goddess is
                                         replicated here in the form of a silver-plated waterhole which is kept covered by a silver 
                                         kalash (auspicious water jar). The Swasthani Brata Katha chronicles the origin of the temple.
                                          Following the death by self-immolation in a fire by his beloved consort Sati Devi, a grief-stricken 
                                          Shiva wandered aimlessly across the earth carrying her dead body on his shoulders. In the course 
                                          of his directionless wandering, the corpse began to rot, and parts of the body fell at different 
                                          places. Wherever those body parts fell, a Shakti Peeth originated, and the Mother Goddess in her 
                                          manifestation as the consort of Lord Shiva came to stay there. Gods, sages and celestial beings 
                                          came to the Shakti Peeths to do penance or offer worship to the goddess (Ishwari), and thus 
                                          these spots became holy places. It was at this spot that the Guhya
                                         (anal portion) of the corpse fell, and hence this place came to be known as Guhyeshwari.

                                    Find peace and prayers on the little hillock of Swaymbhunath in the northwest of Kathmandu Valley. 
                                    Visitors for whom the name was a tongue twister have called it "Monkey Temple" from the 1970s. 
                                    Swayambhu, overlooks most parts of the valley giving visitors a panoramic view of the city. 
                                    The stupa has stood as a hallmark of faith and harmony for centuries with Hindu temples and deities incorporated 
                                    in this Buddhist site. The glory of Kathmandu Valley is said to have started from this point.     
                                </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Resting on a hillock 3 km west of Kathmandu, Swayambhu is one of the holiest Buddhist stupas in Nepal. 
                                        It is said to have evolved spontaneously when the valley was created out of a primordial lake more than
                                         2,000 years ago. 
                                        This stupa is the oldest of its kind in Nepal and has numerous shrines and monasteries on its premises.    
                                    </p>
                                   <p>
                                    Swayambhu literally means "self-existent one". Believed to date back to 460 A.D., 
                                    it was built by King Manadeva and by the 13th century, it had become an important center of Buddhism. 
                                    Legend has it that Swayambhu was born out of a lotus flower that bloomed in the middle of a lake that 
                                    once spread across the Kathmandu Valley once was. The largest image of the Sakyamuni Buddha in Nepal 
                                    sits on a high pedestal on the western boundary of Swayambhu beside the Ring Road. Behind the hilltop
                                     is a temple dedicated to Manjusri or Saraswati - the Goddess of learning. Chaityas, statues and shrines 
                                     of Buddhist and Hindu deities fill the stupa complex. The base of the hill is 
                                    almost entirely surrounded by prayer wheels and deities. Devotees can be seen circumambulating the stupa at all times.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Exceedingly steep stone steps that lead up to the shrine is quite a challenge. However, 
                                    there is also a motor road going up almost to the top from where it is a short walk.
                                     A large number of Buddhists and Hindus alike visit Swayambhu throughout the day. 
                                     This shrine is perhaps the best place to observe religious harmony in Nepal.
                                     The largest crowds of people are seen here on Buddha's birthday which usually falls in May each year.

                                    The Changu Narayan Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is perched atop a small
                                     hill to the east of Kathmandu in Bhaktapur district. It is one of the best known
                                      Vishnu - Narayan is another name of Vishnu - temples in Nepal and is visited by a 
                                      large number of devotees especially during Harishayani Ekadashi in the month of Ashadh
                                       and Haribodhini Ekadashi in Kartik, over the four month period when Lord Vishnu is 
                                       supposed to retire to sleep. At the front of the temple is a beautiful statue of Garuda
                                        dating back to 5th century Lichchhavi period. This Garuda is unique in that it resembles
                                         a human being except that it has wings unlike other Garuda statues found elsewhere. 
                                         The Garuda is the baahan (carrier) of Lord Vishnu, and it is interesting to note that 
                                    all Vishnu temples have the celestial bird seated on its knee with folded palms in front of the temple.

                                    The temple is one of the most elaborate in the Kathmandu valley, rich in wood and stone carvings. 
                                    It is a two-tiered pagoda structure and was re-constructed in 1702 after the old one was gutted by fire. 
                                    A stone tablet Shilapatra, discovered in the vicinity of the temple, dates from the 5th century, the oldest 
                                    such inscription discovered in Nepal. The main courtyard has several temples and idols of gods with 
                                    intricate carving
                                     in stone accomplished between the 5th to 12th centuries, making it the highest concentration of ancient art in Nepal.

                                <p>
                                    The temple has a gilded copper roof with a pinnacle. On each of the four doorways are four toranas,
                                     or exquisitely carved crest suspended over the door. In the temple courtyard are pillars on which 
                                     are positioned the four divine possessions of Lord Vishnu consisting of the sankha (conch), chakra (discus),
                                      gadaa (mace) and padma (lotus). The temple complex also contains the idol of Vishnu Vishwarup considered by
                                       some to be one of the most beautiful idols ever made in Nepal. There are also smaller shrines dedicated to
                                        Goddess Chhinnamasta (goddess devoid of a head), Badeshwar Mahadev, Laxmi Narayan and Kileshwar. In the
                                         northeast corner of the courtyard is the beautiful bas-relief of Vishnu mounting on the back of the Garuda
                                          which dates from the 12th century. The importance of this image can be ascertained from the fact that it 
                                          features in the Nepalese 10 rupee banknote. Although Changu Narayan is primarily a site sacred to the 
                                          Vaishnavites, there are also idols of Shiva and Durga, making it a site equally important to the Shaivas
                                           and Shakti upasaks, 
                                    thus demonstrating a high degree of mutual respect and tolerance between the different sects within Hinduism.

                                    <strong style="font-weight: 700;">Access: </strong>Changu Narayan is situated 12 km to the east of Kathmandu. 
                                    There are microbuses from Bhaktapur that leave regularly for Changu Narayan.
                                     Some visitors also trek from Nagarkot to Changu Narayan and return to Kathmandu via Bhaktapur.
