        <h3>For connecting remote areas through internet using wireless technologies.</h3>
        <p>
            Mahabir Pun is well known in Nepal for his extensive work in rural villages in fields of health, education and awareness program-mes by connecting those remote areas through internet using wireless technologies.
            Born in Nangi Village, Myagdi District which is in the Himalayan foothills of western Nepal. Although it takes 7 hours hard climb to reach Nangi and not even a presence of telephone line, Mahabir's determination to connect
            his village to rest of the world has succeeded by using wireless internet technology. 
        <br>
        Pun who had difficult times during his childhood for getting education in Nagi, his father moved their family to Nepal's 
        lowlands so that his son could get educated. After finishing high school Pun started teaching in local school for 8 years 
        and finally got scholarship to complete his bachelor's degree at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. After finishing his bachelors 
        he didn't settle in US but returned to his village Nagi after almost 20 years to help the local youth to get better education.
        <br>
        At that time Nangi's leaders will establishing a village high school and in which Pun happily got involved and once
         a month he had to travel 2 days to nearest town of Pokhara to check his e-mail and contact his friends abroad and 
         asking for little help for his village. Finally in 1997, a donation of four used computers from Australia arrived,
          but there was no electricity to run them. After Pun's initiative, they generated enough power to run the computers
           from small hydro generators run from a nearby stream and he started teaching computer classes at Nangi high school. After this
         success more computers followed but they were not connected to the internet and was impossible to get a telephone connection from Pokhara.
        <br>
        To solve this, Mahabir e-mailed the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), asking for ideas to help connect his village. 
        In 2001, the BBC publicized his dilemma and within a year volunteers from Europe and the United States were helping him 
        setup a wireless connection between Nangi and the neighboring village of Ramche, using TV dish antennas mounted in the 
        trees. Small grants along with the volunteers soon led to the construction of improvised mountaintop relay stations and 
        a link to Pokhara and by 2003 Nangi was online. This was a big news in World Wide Web and group of backpacking volunteers
         along with many donated computers, parts and equipment were carried up into the hills. Pun expanded the wireless network
         to 12 villages and distributed ninety used computers to the local schools and communication centers, 
        connecting them to the internet, teaching teachers how to use them, and then troubleshooting until everything worked.
            <br>
            Now by the help of internet people from Myagdi are learning through Pun's "tele-teaching", good teachers in one school 
            now instruct students in others. Local health workers use Wi-Fi to consult to the specialists in Pokhara, students learn 
            global skills by surfing the net and villagers e-market local products such as buffaloes cheese, honey and teas. Also 
            they are drawing more trekkers to their houses by offering them internet services. Similarly in parallel projects Mahabir 
            has helped villagers to use solar 
            power for energy needs, people of Nangi have added a library, health clinic, and new high-school classrooms.
            <br>
            Even after these contributions to society Mahabir has lifelong vision for improving rural Nepal.
             He states that "I believe that visions will only be wishes if we don't share it and work on it".
             His 
            <br>
            <strong style="font-weight: 700;">First vision</strong> is to "setup vocational training schools for rural people so that the young can get better jobs in the national and international job market"
            <br>
            <strong style="font-weight: 700;">Second vision</strong> is to "help people start income generating programs in rural areas that are viable there to create the local economy and to create jobs locally"
            <br>
            <strong style="font-weight: 700;">Third vision</strong> is to "establish a college by 2015 and a university later on for the children of poor people, who can't afford to go to college or university"
            <br>
            <strong style="font-weight: 700;">Fourth vision</strong> is to "bring information and communication technology to the remote villages of my country and use it for educational, medical, commercial and communication purposes"
